# Point Cloud Visualizer

## Description
A simple point cloud visualizer using PyQt5 and Vispy. Visualizes points from a `.ply` or `.pts` file in 3D space, allowing users to interactively view and explore the data.

## Usage
1. Install dependencies: `PyQt5`, `vispy`, and `pyntcloud`.
2. Run `main.py` to execute the program.
3. Use the slider to adjust the point size in the visualization.

## Discussion

### Weaknesses of Visualization
- **Performance**: Handling large point clouds may result in performance degradation.
- **Detail Loss**: Simplistic rectangular splats might lack detail for certain datasets.
- **Interactivity**: Limited tools for analyzing and interacting with the data.
  
### Challenges
- **Data Size**: Managing and visualizing large datasets efficiently.
- **Detail Preservation**: Ensuring important details are not lost during visualization.
- **Usability**: Balancing between simplicity and providing powerful visualization tools.

### Improvements
- **Optimization**: Implement LOD (Level of Detail) or spatial partitioning (e.g., octrees) to improve performance.
- **Enhanced Interactivity**: Provide tools to inspect, select, or analyze specific points.
- **Improved Visuals**: Experiment with different splatting/shading techniques for better depth perception.
